<p>This medical suction pump unit is used to remove fluids like mucus, blood, saliva, or phlegm that are causing obstructions on the airway or respiratory system and infectious materials from wounds.</p>



<p>9E-A suction unit can cater to both adult and pediatric patients.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>20L/min suction rate</li>



<li>AC Mains Power</li>
</ul>



<p>Portable Phlegm Suction Machine is a newly designed machine for oil-free lubrication pump, so that the environment is free from oil mist pollution. 9E-A aspirator is specifically designed for absorbing thick liquids such as blood and phlegm.</p>



<p>PORTABLE. This device is built in such a way that it can be transported with ease to any setting with power source. It can be used in hospitals, for emergency responders to secure airway on the way to the hospital, and for in-home patients requiring respiratory suction.</p>



<p>LIGHTWEIGHT. Coming in at 3.9 kg, this device is easy to be transported and set up in any location inside the hospitals or clinics. This feature is helpful especially in emergency situations where aspiration is to be done immediately.</p>



<p>EASY TO USE. This product comes in with a user manual with all the instructions clearly stated and easily understood. Being user-friendly, it is designed to be simple for rapid use.</p>



<p>EFFECTIVE NEGATIVE PRESSURE. With a maximum vacuum pressure of -75 kPa and a 20L/min suction rate, the device is capable of suctioning thick secretions such as phlegm and blood, or foreign substances from the person’s airway. It is adjustable in a way that it can cater to adult and pediatric patients.</p>



<p>BACTERIAL FILTER. This product is equipped with filters to prevent contamination with the aspirator’s inner components and to protect against dust and dangerous gases that can damage the machine.</p>

<p>An ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) is a&nbsp;multi-well&nbsp;plate-based immunoassay within which one of the assay components, typically an antibody&nbsp;or sample, is adsorbed onto a solid surface, in this case, a plate. Offering rapid, quantitative, and sensitive analyte detection at relatively low cost, ELISAs represent one of the simplest assay formats to perform. Furthermore, the ease of adapting an ELISA to a higher throughput screening method empowers researchers to test large sample numbers in a single run.</p>



<p>Our ELISAs are a convenient and user-friendly method for studying soluble protein biomarkers in a variety of matrices including serum, plasma, cell culture supernatant, or lysate. Our ELISA offering consists of &gt;1,000 Research Use Only assays, against a wide variety of species including human, mouse, rat, and various other animal models (Agricultural and Companion). Each assay comes with a specific protocol and the required reagents to run a 96-well plate. ELISAs primarily exist in a 96-well format with the vendor providing the reagents necessary to detect and quantitate the target. There are a variety of ELISA methods including Sandwich, Direct, and Competitive.</p>



<p>The sandwich assay uses a pair of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against different epitopes against the same target. The primary mAb, bound to the plate, pulls the protein out of the solution while the second mAb is used to complete the “sandwich” and provide the signal which will indicate the presence of the target. A known amount of the recombinant version of the protein is provided with the kit, allowing the user to create a standard curve against which the signal from one of the samples will be interpreted. The majority of our portfolio is in this sandwich ELISA format.</p>



<p>The direct ELISA and competitive assays are rarer. The direct assay uses a single mAb to detect the sample which is bound to the plate. The mAb is then bound by a reporter secondary antibody to provide the signal.</p>



<p>The competitive assay has a known amount of the biomarker pre-bound to the plate. A labeled antibody is co-incubated with the sample which “mops up” the antibody depending on the concentration of the target in the sample. The free antibody is then able to bind to the antigen on the plate and provide a signal after the sample is washed away. In this case, the signal is inversely proportional to the concentration of the target biomarker.</p>

<p>Transglutaminases are a family of enzymes that catalyse the posttranslational modification of proteins by inserting an isopeptide bond within or between polypeptide chains (Folk, J. E. and Cole, P. W., 1966). These enzymes catalyse the acyl transfer reaction between the γ-carboxyamide group of peptide-bound glutamine residues and a variety of primary amines, particularly the ε-amino group of lysine (Lorand L. et al., 1962). The resulting cross link is of great significance, since it is highly stable and also resistant to mechanical and proteolytic degradation.</p>



<p>The MICROBIAL TRANSGLUTAMINASE ASSAY KIT uses Z-Gln-Gly as the amine acceptor substrate and hydroxylamine as amine donor. In the presence of MTG hydoxylamine is incorporated into&nbsp;Z-Gln-Gly to form Z-glutamylhxdroxamate-glycine which develops a colored complex with iron (III) detectable at 525 nm.</p>



<p>(A1) ACTIVITY REAGENT 1: lyophilized TRIS buffer containing Z-Gln-Gly and reduced glutathione, 3 vials<br>(A2) ACTIVITY REAGENT 2: Hydroxylamine, 3 vials<br>(S) STOP REAGENT: Hydrochloric acid [4% v/v], Iron (III) chloride, 3 vials<br>(P1) MICROBIAL TRANSGLUTAMINASE (positive control): 3 vials</p>



<p>The MICROBIAL TRANSGLUTAMINASE ASSAY KIT can be used in standard spectrophotometers with polystyrene 1 mL cuvettes. Refer to the instructions of the manufacturer.</p>



<p>P1 has to be stored at -20°C (shipment is possible at 4 – 8°C).&nbsp;<br>A1, A2, S has to be stored at 4 – 8°C.&nbsp;<br>The unopened reagents are stable until the expiration date printed on the box.</p>
