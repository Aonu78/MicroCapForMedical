Offering rapid, quantitative, and sensitive analyte detection at relatively low cost, ELISAs represent one of the simplest assay formats to perform. Furthermore, the ease of adapting an ELISA to a higher throughput screening method empowers researchers to test large sample numbers in a single run.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our ELISAs are a convenient and user-friendly method for studying soluble protein biomarkers in a variety of matrices including serum, plasma, cell culture supernatant, or lysate. Our ELISA offering consists of &gt;1,000 Research Use Only assays, against a wide variety of species including human, mouse, rat, and various other animal models (Agricultural and Companion). Each assay comes with a specific protocol and the required reagents to run a 96-well plate. ELISAs primarily exist in a 96-well format with the vendor providing the reagents necessary to detect and quantitate the target. There are a variety of ELISA methods including Sandwich, Direct, and Competitive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sandwich assay uses a pair of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against different epitopes against the same target. The primary mAb, bound to the plate, pulls the protein out of the solution while the second mAb is used to complete the \u201csandwich\u201d and provide the signal which will indicate the presence of the target. A known amount of the recombinant version of the protein is provided with the kit, allowing the user to create a standard curve against which the signal from one of the samples will be interpreted. The majority of our portfolio is in this sandwich ELISA format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The direct ELISA and competitive assays are rarer. The direct assay uses a single mAb to detect the sample which is bound to the plate. The mAb is then bound by a reporter secondary antibody to provide the signal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The competitive assay has a known amount of the biomarker pre-bound to the plate. A labeled antibody is co-incubated with the sample which \u201cmops up\u201d the antibody depending on the concentration of the target in the sample. The free antibody is then able to bind to the antigen on the plate and provide a signal after the sample is washed away. In this case, the signal is inversely proportional to the concentration of the target biomarker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-1 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"https:\/\/microcapformedical.com\/contact-us\/\">BUY NOW<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>An ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) is a&nbsp;multi-well&nbsp;plate-based immunoassay within which one of the assay components, typically an antibody&nbsp;or sample, is adsorbed onto a solid surface, in this case, a plate.
